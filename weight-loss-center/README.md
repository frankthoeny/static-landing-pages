## Installation and Running
**Using `npm install` and `npm run dev`**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    * Verify your Node.js project directory contains a `package.json` file.
    * Ensure the `package.json` file has a "dev" script defined within the "scripts" section.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to your project's root directory.
    * Execute the command: `npm install`
    * This will download and install the packages listed in `package.json` into the `node_modules` folder, and create or update `package-lock.json`.

3.  **Start Development Server:**
    * After the installation completes, run: `npm run dev`
    * This command will execute the script defined under "dev" in your `package.json` file, typically starting your development server.
